# Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

In this notebook we investigate two Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) flavors for node classification - for directed and undirected graphs.
First, we look into the popular undirected graph example of Zachary's karate club network, and then into an analytical implementation of the GCNConv, a flavor spiked to suit directed graphs trained on the WikiCS dataset. Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/JonnaBuri/Graph-Neural-Networks/blob/main/Image%20classification%20with%20LR%2C%20MLP%2C%20CNNs%20(Elements%20of%20AI%20demo%20session).ipynb)!
