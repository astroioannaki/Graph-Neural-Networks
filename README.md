# Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

In this notebook we investigate two Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) flavors for node classification - for directed and undirected graphs.
First, we look into the popular undirected graph example of Zachary's karate club network, and then into an analytical implementation of the GCNConv, a flavor spiked to suit directed graphs trained on the WikiCS dataset.
